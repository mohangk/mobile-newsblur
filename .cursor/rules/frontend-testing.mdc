# Frontend Testing Guide

Frontend TypeScript modules are tested using [Vitest](mdc:https:/vitest.dev) and [JSDOM](mdc:https:/github.com/jsdom/jsdom).

## Key Components:

-   **Test Runner:** Vitest (run via `npm test` in the `frontend/` directory - see [frontend/package.json](mdc:frontend/package.json)).
-   **Environment:** JSDOM simulates a browser DOM environment within Node.js.
-   **Setup:** [frontend/vitest.setup.js](mdc:frontend/vitest.setup.js) configures the JSDOM environment before tests run.
-   **Test Files:** Located alongside the code they test:
    -   [frontend/js/app.test.ts](mdc:frontend/js/app.test.ts) (Tests main application logic)
    -   [frontend/js/ui.test.ts](mdc:frontend/js/ui.test.ts) (Tests DOM manipulation functions)
    -   [frontend/js/api.test.ts](mdc:frontend/js/api.test.ts) (Tests API wrapper functions)
-   **Mocking:** `vi.mock()` is used to mock module dependencies (e.g., mocking `ui.ts` and `api.ts` within `app.test.ts`) and `vi.fn()` or `vi.spyOn()` is used for mocking functions like `fetch`.

Refer to the Testing section in the main [README.md](mdc:README.md) for commands.
